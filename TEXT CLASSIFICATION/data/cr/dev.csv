no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	2
the container is hard to open , which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler , and you do have to flip the handle carefully \( which has saved more than a few of her toys , too \) i don 't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby	1
buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks	2
versatile and stylish	1
works pretty well	1
the general button placement is not very user friendly	2
although it has chubby hips , the device isn 't really so big	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times \( 4 5 times in a 4 5 hour period \) normally this would cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly \( or maybe it 's just my computer \)	2
i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i 'll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so	1
for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price	1
and also , since it is teri band and since it uses sim card , you can just use it in europe and many other parts of the world , wherever gsm exists	1
the door would not close	2
the sound quality is fantastic \( cd quality \) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !	1
it is without even a slight doubt , my new favorite	1
and it 's the largest diaper pail i 've seen without taking up more floor space	1
i occasionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly \( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode \)	2
the camera is solid , performs well , takes good pictures , and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3	1
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	2
the diaper genie needs it 's own refill bags in order to work and that 's just more money that you don 't have to spend	2
it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk	1
this camera is bulletproof	1
this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation	1
i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive	1
so i e mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive \( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs \)	2
i was using the cheaper pail and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart	1
i love this camera	1
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed	2
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sis , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings	2
believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad	1
again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files just subscription drm encoded files , like those from napster to go or yahoo music unlimited	2
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob	2
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre existing router \( mine does \) , without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard wired pc or a wireless equipped pc	2
i forgot , the case does n 't fit	2
cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality	2
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming	2
the edge guide is top quality , easy to install and accurate	1
this is a great deal , and i 'm elated with my decision to go with hitachi 's green machine	1
with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive	1
when the overall image quality \( especially natural colours , details , natural looking of the pictures \) is the most important thing , then this camera its top notch and very impressive	1
first , it failed whenever connecting to get updates	2
maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it	2
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with `` canned air ``	2
i 've also had the nomad zen lock up several times	2
it works great	1
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
you have to wonder why creative can 't get this right	2
took hundreds of pictures and they were great	1
unlike some of the other people who received a `` lemon `` , my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package	1
transferring music is a breeze i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes	1
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
sometimes , various applications crash	2
i do give create to creative for their attractive design	1
while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with `` alerts `` every twenty seconds \( literally \) , warning me my antivirus protection was off	2
i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router , just get the wrt54g	1
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukebox ed \( ipod , archos , dell , samsung \)	1
the design of the col lets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craft man \( toy junk \) routers i have previously purchased	1
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
main dial is not backlit	2
i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer	2
however after playing with it for three weeks now , i 'm convinced , the zen micro is superior	1
i think the interface is great	1
as far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price remember this router is the same one that was released right when the g standard was introduced to the market	1
speaking of battery , it 's removable and replaceable !	1
i 'm amazed at the photo quality prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints	1
there is an open source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features	1
go for the champ	1
ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well	1
camera is a paper weight	1
the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company	1
itunes this is a love hate relationship program usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod	1
this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway	2
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's	1
7 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal	1
there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things	1
by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch	1
not so nice things a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing \( outside of a table \) the 1 4 `` chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping	2
the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n 't	1
i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker	1
update the finish is more `` mirror `` than silver and i like it !	1
this phone is very user friendly , easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require !	1
audio is mono and fairly acceptable , quiet also with little distortions	1
the instructions that come with it do n 't explain how to make things simple	2
the support has been less than impressive , considering the cost	2
it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video	1
their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions	1
to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
but about 25 of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	2
the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that `` creates `` folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best	2
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes	2
for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages	1
1 a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet	2
further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod	1
this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard	1
once a depth is locked , it will jump off a little while working	2
finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier	2
it has n't gone below the second notch \( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it \) , so the battery life seems fine \( so far \)	1
this is really a nice diaper pail	1
i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon	1
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !	2
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have 50 75 success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	2
cons difficult to open to change bag twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out leaving dirty diapers all over the floor	2
there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the `` knowledge `` database at linksys com , and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour , then gave me a web site address to consult that turned out to be the one i 'd already found during a search of my own	2
no need for deodorizers	1
i wo n 't go into the details here , as the online sites \( steve 's digicams , previews \) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment	1
i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you	2
all the buttons necessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
i love this phone	1
i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture	2
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee !	2
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s	1
putting the micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything \( unless the hold feature is improved it asks if you want to `` unholy `` for every button up press \) second , i 'm worried about the durability of the player	2
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want	1
i purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the ct people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed	1
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot	2
reset the network , tried the connection , and it 's working like a charm	1
the camera and video functionality is decent , i can 't see myself wasting my time with it , but some people will	1
there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive	2
the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it \( a stand , a belt hook , charger \) that i know doesn 't come with every one	1
i like the size and shape	1
the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also	1
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well	1
video recording is limited at just 9 seconds	2
3 play java games on it	1
i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso 's but i don 't really care that much , i think it gives the pictures a certain real life quality	1
but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera	1
utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list	1
oh and file transfers are fast easy	1
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience	2
in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus	1
this thing is trash	2
it 's so cute and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
after installation , which was very simple i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music	1
also much less stinky	2
you can use the ob ex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux \( kde bluetooth provides a nice integration into conqueror for this \) for sending files to the phone	1
minor complaints 1 \) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	2
great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !	1
powerup is quick , and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on	1
i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great	1
i was willing to live with the larger size \( inconvenient on the road \) but the durability was a big zero	2
it takes great pictures	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	2
you can create playlists , drag drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player	1
and it is very easy to clean	1
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks \( even in bright light \) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash	2
sure they say if it 's their fault you won 't get charged , but they are the ones who get to decide whether it 's their fault	2
i did n 't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under 1500 i 'm thrilled with my purchase !	1
the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 !	1
right now , the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly	2
this did manage to cut the number of pop ups during start up from 4 down to 2	1
they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger	1
this router has soft start and runs smooth and true	1
the songs do n 't play one after another like on a cd	2
the phone is sturdy	1
it has given me zero problems , and the more i use it , the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths	1
the sound is quite good , in terms of volume	1
whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase	1
they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping 15 to `` handle `` and ship a cd \? and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails	2
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig	1
the storage capacity is great	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box	1
saw the hitachi on amazon com with their 25 00 coupon \( at the time \) and could not resist trying it out	1
battery life is about 1 4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players \( on or off line \) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive	2
\( batteries last longer too ! \)	1
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !	1
you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it	1
6 play game boy color games on it with go boy	1
also , diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston	2
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality	1
getting the router setup in a `` vanilla `` configuration that works for 99 of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no problem	1
i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it it 's size	1
the speed is the same as dali up , where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up	1
the m12v has been great	1
it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket	1
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view	1
seemed like a good deal , but this pps frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes , `` no disc ``	2
i haven 't seen any problems yet , but if you don 't like to tinker a bit , this player can be a little challenging to set up	2
i upgraded from nis 2003 , and the change in performance has not been noticeable	1
one beef is the scroll , it does n 't work as well as i 'd like	2
too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time	2
i 'm currently using a sony vaio s 150 \( which i bought at the end of this past august \) , and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system in fact , i 've taken to just hibernating , rather than shutting down completely	2
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well	1
7 \) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
it 's so small and light , even with a spare battery , you really can take it anywhere	1
very easy to use for someone like me who 's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does n 't load on some computers	2
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception	1
this one is particularly bothersome allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another	2
after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace , i decided on the s100	1
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas	2
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	2
after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking	1
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the plusses are the features , look , good signal and battery life , memory size and robustness	1
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use	1
getting files onto it is quick and painless	1
the interface software itself , which should be user friendly , was anything but easy to use	2
creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices	1
so far \( 3 weeks \) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images \( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !	2
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	2
it is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand use	1
it 's very quiet for a universal motor driven tool , and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great	1
pros 1 speed 2 signal strength 3 advanced configuration options	1
it is mindless to operate	1
definitely a great camera	1
although i disabled norton antispam , it is still there	2
difficult navigation i wo n 't necessarily say `` difficult , `` but i do n 't enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate	2
i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n 't had any problems	1
i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone	2
i 've been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well	1
fm radio built in \( howard stern \)	1
finally , i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	2
i have noticed an odor \( one the i expected ! \) when unloading the diaper champ but at least you don 't smell anything every time you use it	2
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now	2
it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well designed , doesn 't look to ostentatious while i 'm walking around with it	1
the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good masada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results	1
we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only \( no firewall or utilities \) and so far it 's great	1
i then tried to set up the router through linksys 's browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd , i had little luck i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up	2
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error \?	2
it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly	2
the ad 1600 did n 't work correctly from the start and the ad 1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	2
other than that , i love this camera	1
the pictures are beautiful , and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere	1
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 \?	1
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data	2
creative was defiantly giving the ipod a run for their money with this device	1
i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini	1
the sound is great , the portability , etc all the `` stuff `` you expect from a good mp 3 player , this zen micro has it	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	2
fyi , battery doesn 't die if you don 't use lcd	1
was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an mac	2
another thing you should know , the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky , and scratches very easily	2
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer	1
fm receiver it has none	2
creative did an awesome job with the design	1
it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	2
other tagging problems result \( i think \) from the nomad 's operating system	2
from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3 1 4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price	1
wow was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke	1
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful	1
this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
3 \) the nomad explorer \( winxp style interface \) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player	1
great phone , i 'd buy another	1
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cmdr cadre dvd dvd , and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the giff , progressive scan feature	1
a wise investment for the pocketbook for the nose ! ! !	1
also , the instruction manual is very bad	2
the sound is incredible very clean , very wide dynamic range of bass , midas and highs , and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast	1
the cons are n 't really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it 's based on the title of the songs many of my songs where separated into folders \( on the pc \) and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another	2
i also wanted to switch to broad com hardware \( which the linksys uses \) because my wifi menisci card in my dell laptop with lucien silicon in it used 70 of my 1 2ghz laptop 's cpu when using the wireless at full speed	1
i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book !	1
\( we wrap them nice and tight \) we use our regular kitchen trash bags cheap !	1
looks and durability i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface	2
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n 't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem	2
while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player	1
i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers	1
this router acts as a wireless access point , 100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device	1
i love this product !	1
once again it won 't reinstall , even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians	2
look at the size of it !	1
i use the same store brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it no special `` diaper `` trash bags necessary	1
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine	2
simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use	1
2 it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use	2
4 play n gage games on it	1
apex does n 't answer the phone	2
the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well	1
unfortunately i was wrong	2
i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it	2
it holds almost a week 's worth of diapers , and you don 't need expensive refills any kitchen bags work	1
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome	1
it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery \( and batter life \) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel	1
i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v	1
the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer	1
great video clip quality for a digital camera so much better than my old one \( canon a60 \( \? \) the 2 0 megapixel one \)	1
the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers	1
output went black and white only via both s video and composite connections , and with no v hold	2
i love the touchpaper controls	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1 4 hp models	1
sharper pictures	1
this is quite simply the best you can ask for	1
it would not hang up on calls	2
good image quality	1
there is no odor and extremely easy to use	1
in conclusion , this player is beautiful	1
only thing i don 't like about it is slow in changing apps , boot up , and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth	2
i am bored with the silver look	2
the appearance is okay ed \( at least not ugly \)	1
we don 't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail !	1
after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex \( flor 3 months \) , but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support	2
its well made and user friendly	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out \( as all lithium batteries do \) , you will be able to buy another easily	1
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times	2
and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its ' own	1
i can not find a carrier for this phone i like , end up just tossing it in my purse	2
i tried to do this by instinct and it 's not intuitive unless you are a network geek	2
i have no problems with the touch pad \( once the sensitivity is set to low \) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual	1
the opening could be a little wider , i suppose , but i haven 't really seen anything else that could be improved	2
this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another	1
1 \) quite bulky \( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectors s 1 aps slr \) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contracted mostly of plastic \( unlike canon 's elph line \)	2
norton 's memory usage on systems with 512 mb is very low	1
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	2
one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing	2
it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket , and i don 't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable	1
but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design	2
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
